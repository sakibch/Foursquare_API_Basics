# Foursquare_API_Basics

* In this notebook, we learn in detail how to make calls to the Foursquare API for different purposes. 
* We will learn how to construct a URL to send a request to the API to search for a specific type of venues, to explore a particular venue, to explore a Foursquare user, to explore a geographical location, and to get trending venues around a location. 
* Also, we will learn how to use the visualization library, Folium, to visualize the results.
